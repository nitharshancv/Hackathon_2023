# Hackathon_2023
The Reinforcement Learning-Based Pong Game project is an implementation of the classic Pong game where an AI agent learns to play the game using Q-learning, a popular reinforcement learning technique. The goal of the project is to demonstrate how an AI agent can learn optimal strategies through trial and error.

Key Components:

Game Mechanics: The project includes a Pong game with two paddles and a ball. The objective is to control one of the paddles and prevent the ball from passing it, while also attempting to make the ball pass the opponent's paddle.

Q-learning: The core of the project is the implementation of Q-learning, a reinforcement learning algorithm. Q-learning is used to train an AI agent to make decisions (select actions) that maximize cumulative rewards over time.

AI Agent: An AI agent is introduced into the game to learn and improve its performance. The agent observes the game state, selects actions based on its learned Q-values, and updates those Q-values as it gains more experience.

Training and Learning: During the training phase, the AI agent plays multiple episodes of the game, interacting with the environment. It explores different actions, receives rewards based on its performance, and adjusts its Q-values accordingly.

Exploration vs. Exploitation: The project explores the trade-off between exploration (trying new actions) and exploitation (choosing known high-reward actions). Strategies like epsilon-greedy are used to balance exploration and exploitation.

Evaluation and Final Game: After training, the project allows the AI agent to play the game using the learned Q-values. This demonstrates how the agent's performance has improved and how it can play the game optimally.

Visualization: The game provides a visual representation of the Pong environment, allowing users to see the AI agent in action as it learns and plays.

Customization: The codebase is designed to be customizable. Users can modify game parameters, learning rates, exploration strategies, and other aspects to experiment with different training scenarios.

Overall, this project serves as an educational example of applying reinforcement learning, specifically Q-learning, to a simple game environment. It highlights the AI agent's ability to learn effective strategies through iterative gameplay and provides insights into the balance between exploration and exploitation in reinforcement learning. Users can observe how Q-learning helps the AI agent gradually improve its performance in playing Pong.
